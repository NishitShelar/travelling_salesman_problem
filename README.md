# TSP Solver using GWO (Basic and Advanced), GA, ACO, PSO

## Overview
This project compares five optimization algorithms on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP):
- Basic Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO Basic)
- Advanced Modified Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO Advanced)
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

## How to Run
1. Download `berlin52.tsp` file and put it inside the `datasets/` folder.
   - Download from [TSPLIB - Berlin52](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keknure/berlin52)
2. Install required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
